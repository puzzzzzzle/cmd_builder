#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenvâ€™s lock file may lock out other developers due to
#   environments differing. You can choose to include it according to your needs.

# It's generally a good idea to include the poetry.lock file in version control.
